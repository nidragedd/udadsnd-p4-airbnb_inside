# What is it ? Global overview
This project is only for educational purposes. I did it while I was following the `Udacity DataScience nanodegree`.  
Within the course, in order to develop our communication skills as DataScientist, we are asked to pick a dataset
available on the Internet. There are suggestions but we can take any dataset as soon as we explore it and follow the 
CRISP-DM process:
* Business Understanding
* Data Understanding
* Data Preparation
* Modeling
* Evaluation
* Deployment

There are 2 main objectives to reach in this project:
* create a Github code repository to share code, scripts, notebooks and documentation about data wrangling/modeling
 techniques, with a technical audience in mind
* write a blog post accessible to non-technical people in order to share our questions, insights, findings, thoughts
 and conclusions.

I chose to use datasets from airbnb and, as a french people, I chose Paris as the city to analyze.

## Build your environment
Easiest way is to create a virtual environment through **[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)**
and the given `environment.yml` file by running this command in a terminal (if you have conda, obviously):
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

If you do not have/want to use conda for any reason, you can still setup your environment by running some `pip install`
commands. Please refer to the `environment.yml` file to see what are the dependencies you will need to install.  
Basically, this project requires **Python 3.7** and the following Python libraries installed:
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) (I used 1.16.4)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) (I used 0.24.2)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) (I used 3.1.0)
- [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) to run the notebook

**TODO**: to complete with perhaps seaborn
sklearn
gensim
spacy

## What you will find in this project
explain the questions & answers

You will find several notebooks, one for each part of the CRISP-DM process. Start by this [one](notebook/0_Summary.ipynb)
to enter the process.  
You can read the blog post here (**TODO**: put the link once it is written)
