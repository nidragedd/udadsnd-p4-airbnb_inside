    "This project is only for educational purposes. I did it while I was following the `Udacity DataScience nanodegree`.  \n",
    "Within the course, in order to develop our communication skills as DataScientist, we are asked to pick a dataset available on the Internet. There are suggestions but we can take any dataset as soon as we explore it and follow the CRISP-DM process:\n",
    "![CRIP-DM process](../assets/CRISP-DM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main objectives to reach in this project:\n",
    "* create a Github code repository to share code, scripts, notebooks and documentation about data wrangling/modeling techniques, with a technical audience in mind\n",
    "* write a blog post accessible to non-technical people in order to share our questions, insights, findings, thoughts and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to use datasets from airbnb and, as a french people, I chose Paris as the city to analyze.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you do not have/want to use conda for any reason, you can still setup your environment by running some `pip install` commands.  \n",

    "* collect 5 datasets from insideairbnb website"
